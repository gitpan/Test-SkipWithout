NAME
    Test::SkipWithout - Skip a test if a module is missing, or an
    insufficient version.

DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes a test should only run if specific modules are installed.
    Other times a test should only run when a sufficient version of a module
    is available. This module lets you do this quickly without writing your
    own evals.

    This Module will skip if the conditions are not met. It is also smart
    enough to notice when a module fails to load, or fails its version check
    due to an exception. All exceptions are rethrown except for those
    related to a version mismatch or module not being installed.

SYNOPSYS
        use Test::More;

        use Test::SkipWithout 'My::Widget';

        my $widget = My::Widget->new;

        ok($widget, "Made a widget!");

        done_testing;

    You can also specify a minimum version

        use Test::More;

        use Test::SkipWithout 'My::Widget' => '2.005';

        my $widget = My::Widget->new;

        ok($widget, "Made a widget!");

        done_testing;
